## github-pages-star-search-20260525

- timestamp: 2026-05-25T13:16:19.0816496-05:00
- what: Added a static GitHub Pages search app for starred repositories under `docs/`.
- why: The project was CLI-only, while the requested product is a github.io search surface for users to search their GitHub stars.
- components: `docs/index.html`, `docs/styles.css`, `docs/app.js`, `docs/.nojekyll`, `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- type: feature
- validation: Pending automated build/static checks and browser verification.
- performance: Client search is local after paginated GitHub API fetch; no benchmark-sensitive server path changed.
- risks: GitHub API rate limits apply for unauthenticated public-star loading; private stars require a token entered client-side.
- follow_up: Consider a GitHub OAuth device flow or backend proxy if the project needs non-token private-star access.
